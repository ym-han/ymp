I like reading, learning recreational mathematics, and doing traditional martial arts. I used to write poetry; I hope to return to that in the near future.

I am also an enthusiastic user of speech recognition. If you need to use speech to use your computer, I highly recommend Talon [https://talonvoice.com], a nifty piece of software that, together with speech engines like Dragon, allows for hands-free computer use. I'd be very happy to talk to humanities academics / non-technical people who want to know more about what it's been like using it.
