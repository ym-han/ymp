I'm a doctoral candidate in the Philosophy department at Brown. I grew up in Singapore, and did my undergraduate work there, at The National University of Singapore.

My main research interests are in moral philosophy. Much of my work involves using moral psychological premises to establish conclusions in metaethics and normative ethics. In particular, my primary research program involves advancing a broadly neo-Humean, subjectivist view in moral philosophy, one at whose core is the claim that our loves and cares are not based on reasons. But I also have research programs on issues at the interface of thought and speech.

My teaching interests include critical thinking, applied ethics (healthcare ethics, ethics of technology), aesthetics (especially food and literature), and the philosophy of gender, race, and post-colonialism.
