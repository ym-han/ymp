I'm a doctoral candidate in the Philosophy department at Brown. My main research interests are in moral philosophy, though I have research programs on issues at the interface of thought and speech. 

My primary research program involves advancing a broadly neo-Humean, subjectivist view in moral philosophy, one at whose core is the claim that our loves and cares are not based on reasons.

My teaching interests include critical thinking, applied ethics (healthcare ethics, ethics of technology), aesthetics (especially food and literature). I hope to eventually be able to teach courses on the philosophy of gender, race, and post-colonialism.

My email is ym_han at brown.edu; my CV can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5lc6zm60x82xj1/ymh%20cv%20phil%20website%20jan%2020.pdf?dl=0).
