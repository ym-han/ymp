  My research tackles issues at the intersection of moral psychology, normative
  ethics, and metaethics, as well as in the philosophy of mind and language. My
  hope, in the longer term, is to start working in addition on topics in the
  philosophy of race, as well as in the ethics of technology.


  Below are various works in progress, organized by theme. Comments are most
  welcome!

# Love and moral cares

My primary research program turns on affairs of the _heart_: it involves advancing a broadly neo-Humean, subjectivist view in moral philosophy, one at whose core is the claim that our loves and cares are not based on reasons. 

* Desire and Loving for Properties (under review)
* Love's Fittingness: a No-Reasons Guide (stable draft available; will be sending out soon)
* In Search of Reasons to Care about Morality (in progress)
* The Heart of Subjectivism (in progress)

# Subsidiary research programs

My subsidiary research programs are about issues at the interface of _thought and communication_ --- though with an eye towards the interplay of these, again, with our more affective states.

* The Residue Approach to Simple Sentences (under review)

> It seems more natural to say, e.g., "Clark went into the phone booth and Superman came out" in describing one of Clark/Superman's transformations than "Superman went into the phone booth and Clark came out". Strikingly, the former seems more natural even if everyone in the conversation knows the identity. In this paper, I argue that the explanation of why we prefer to say one rather than the other of the sentences when we _don't_ know the identity extends also to typical cases where we _do_. For what explains cases where we don't know the identity is that our Clark- and Superman-beliefs are distinct: they play different roles in our psychology. But such distinctness in beliefs isn't the kind of thing that would tend to be erased merely by our coming to know the identity.
