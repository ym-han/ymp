  My research tackles issues at the intersection of moral psychology, normative
  ethics, and metaethics, as well as in the philosophy of mind and language. My
  hope, in the longer term, is to start working in addition on topics in the
  philosophy of race, as well as in the ethics of technology.

Below are various works in progress, organized by theme. Comments are most welcome!

### Love and moral cares

My primary research program turns on affairs of the _heart_: it involves advancing a broadly neo-Humean, subjectivist view in moral philosophy, one at whose core is the claim that our loves and cares are not based on reasons. 

* Desire and Loving for Properties _(under review)_
* Love's Fittingness: a No-Reasons Guide _(stable draft available; will be sending out soon)_
* In Search of Reasons to Care about Morality _(in progress)_
* The Heart of Subjectivism _(in progress)_

### Subsidiary research programs

My subsidiary research programs are about issues at the interface of _thought and communication_ --- though with an eye towards the interplay of these, again, with our more affective states.

* The Residue Approach to Simple Sentences _(under review)_
