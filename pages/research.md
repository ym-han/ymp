My research tackles issues at the intersection of moral psychology, normative ethics, and metaethics, as well as issues in the philosophy of mind and language. My primary research program turns on affairs of the *heart*: it involves advancing a broadly neo-Humean, subjectivist view in moral philosophy, one at whose core is the claim that our loves and cares are not based on reasons. By contrast, my subsidiary research programs are about issues at the interface of *thought and communication* --- though with an eye towards the interplay of these, again, with our more affective states.

# Dissertation

Do we care about the things we do because they seem to us to be good? Call the view that denies this --- that holds that our cares are not responses to reasons --- *subjectivism*. My dissertation (*Subjectivism about Love and Moral Concern*) tackles perhaps the most counterintuitive case for subjectivism, namely, that of *morally* relevant cares and concerns. Think, for instance, of the sheltered adolescent who initially dismisses the victims of structural inequalities as lazy, but who comes to want these inequalities to be addressed after seeing the suffering that they bring, or the way such inequalities are deeply unfair. Or consider someone, raised in a rural area, who begins by finding homosexuality disgusting, but who comes to be averse to discriminating against LGBTQ individuals after seeing that they are really 'no different' from anyone else. Such examples, anti-subjectivists like Michael Smith (1994, 1995), Derek Parfit (1997), and Joseph Raz (1999) have argued, can seem to suggest that our morally relevant cares are like beliefs in admitting of reasons.  

I argue, however, we don't need to invoke reasons to explain how we come to acquire (or lose) morally relevant cares. I do so by first tackling the *prima facie* more subjectivist-friendly question of whether there are reasons for *love*. Love, after all, can exhibit a similar tension: it can seem both reason responsive and yet oblivious to reasons. But I argue that we can explain the ways in which love can seem reason responsive without appealing to reasons. Having warmed up with love, I then return to morally relevant cares, and offer structurally analogous explanations of how such cares might seem explained by reasons.

# Subsidiary research programs

In addition to my research in moral psychology, I also have research programs in philosophy of mind/language and metaethics. 

One of them has to do with the *relationship between thought and communication*. It begins with a paper [title removed for blind review] on how it seems more natural to say, e.g., "Clark went into the phone booth and Superman came out" in describing one of Clark/Superman's transformations than "Superman went into the phone booth and Clark came out". Strikingly, the former seems more natural even if everyone in the conversation knows the identity. In this paper, I argue that the explanation of why we prefer to say one rather than the other of the sentences when we *don't* know the identity extends also to typical cases where we *do* know the identity. For what explains cases where we don't know the identity is that our Clark- and Superman-beliefs are distinct: they play different roles in our psychology. But such distinctness in beliefs isn't the kind of thing that would tend to be erased merely by our coming to know the identity. <!-- Our initial ignorance of the identity, in short, results in a sort of structural difference in our beliefs, a structural difference whose *residue* is what explains why the contrast persists even after the identity is known.-->
